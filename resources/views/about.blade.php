            <h2>About Open Contracting in Moldova</h2>

           <p> In 2015, the Government of Moldova began working with the World Bank to introduce open contracting in public procurement. Open contracting is any effort to increase transparency and participation of different stakeholders in contracting processes. As a result, we developed this website and PPA championed open contracting commitments in the Open Government Partnership National Action Plan (2016) of the Government.</p>
